# Apply-text-styles-Illustrator
Jsx script applies predefined styles to paragraphs or lines to selected text items in Adobe Illustrator. 

## Instructions:

1. Create Character or Paragraph Styles.

2. Rearrange them in styles panel in order you want to be applied to your texts.

3. Select all text frames and run the script.

4. Every paragraph or line in every text frame will be formatted with corresponding style in panel.
(1st paragraph - 1st style, 2nd paragraph - 2nd style, etc.)

## BUG: make sure you dont have empty line in the end of frame.
Last text line in frame ends with "#" in "Show hidden characters alt+cmd+I". If you have empty last line â€” script will alert an error. This is an illustrator bug and I don't know how to handle it yet.
